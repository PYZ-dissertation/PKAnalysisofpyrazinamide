# Full population pharmacokinetic analysis of pyrazinamide in tuberculosis treatment
This repository contains a full population pharmacokinetic (PK) model that investigates the impacts of HIV and other covariates on the PK dynamics of pyrazinamide (PYZ) in 
tuberculosis (TB) treatment. 
The analysis includes an in-depth examination of how various covariates affect patients' exposure to PYZ and the subsequent bacterial clearance.
